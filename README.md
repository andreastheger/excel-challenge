Three conclusions about crowdfunding campaigns- Andreas heger
Theater and music are the most successful parent categories with the most number of backers- and some of the highest average donations per backer. We can draw from this that there is a positive correlation between number of backers and average donation
Theater and music also account for the majority of failed or canceled crowdfunding outcomes 
Some limitations of this chart would be the number of times an ad or a post reached a social media user- which website it was advertised on and what crowdfunding campaign was referenced or advertised
We could create a table filtering what genres of music are most likely to create a successful Kickstarter campaign, in order to inform a group of professional musicians what type of music is most viable/ successful as a campaign.
